Using this method your Pi will put the addons in the correct "addons" folder. As for the remaining files, it will create a "habmin" folder in the "`webapps" folder and dump the files there

Let begin by stopping openHAB. Assuming you followed my previews ible on how to automatically start openHAB on boot , you should have a file called openhab in your /etc/init.d directory. If not no worries, you do not ave to stop openHAB you will simply have to restart openHAB after completing this step.(find it here)


/etc/init.d/openhab stop

Go to the openHAB main directory to download the release there.

cd /opt/openhab

wget https://github.com/cdjackson/HABmin/releases/download/0.1.3-snapshot/habmin.zip

Unzip the file

unzip habmin.zip

Go ahead an restart openHAB

/etc/init.d/openhab start

Thats it. Pretty simple.
