Setting up Watchdog
-------------------
To get watchdog up and running, you'll first need to:
sudo modprobe bcm2708_wdog
sudo vi /etc/modules
# Add the line "bcm2708_wdog"

Next you need watchdog, a daemon which does little more than send /dev/watchdog a heartbeat every 10 seconds. 
It can also run arbitrary executables which do things like ping a server, and can trigger reboot when they fail.
sudo apt-get install watchdog chkconfig
chkconfig watchdog on
sudo /etc/init.d/watchdog start

You should also configure watchdog:
sudo vi /etc/watchdog.conf

Finally, test your watchdog. Make sure you've not got any crucial processes running and ensure you deactivate any swap partitions or files, then test your watchdog with a nasty forkbomb:
: (){ :|:& };:
This will ultimately cause a kernel panic and, if everything is set up correctly, your Pi will reboot a few seconds later.
